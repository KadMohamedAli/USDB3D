# USDB3D
A 3d model of University Saad Dahleb Blida, for now there is only the pavillon 1 (informatique) , a newer and more detailed version of it is coming soon.

Download from here :
Pav1 v0.1 : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-Enyxb2kEGGdARgLlqrQCARrf5edEZSE?usp=drive_link (when importing in UE5 it will take a lot of time to load, you may want to activate nanite, there is no vegetation you must add it in your game engine, there is some bugs they will be fixed in the next update)
